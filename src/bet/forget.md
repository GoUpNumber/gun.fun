# gun bet forget

Delete your memory of a bet from your local database.

## Synopsis

```
gun bet forget [bet-ids]...
```

## Description

There are some bets you'd rather forget about but we can't do anything about that.
This command just deletes a bet from your local database.
This is obviously dangerous depending on the state of the bet so `gun bet forget` will stop you from deleting your coins or warn you when you need to be careful.
