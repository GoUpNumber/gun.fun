## Oracles

For this experiment I developed an oracle called [`olivia`](https://github.com/LLFourn/olivia) and deployed it at [h00.ooo](https://h00.ooo).
`olivia` is badly documented and still changing a lot but you're welcome to try and run your own one.

To find events I developed a simple oracle explorer [outcome.observer](https://outcome.observer) which can browse the events of an oracle.
If you run your own oracle and want me to list it on outcome.observer make a PR to [the repo](https://github.com/LLFourn/outcome-observer).
