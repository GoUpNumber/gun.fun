# Bet Protocol Technical Overview

> ðŸ’¡ You don't have to read this.
> This is only for people who are interested in how the betting protocol actually works.

The protocol takes two messages and one on-chain transaction.

The first message, the "proposal", contains a public key (`P1`) which the second message, the "offer", will be encrypted under.
The offer contains a public key (`P2`) and a ciphertext.
The offer is encrypted by deriving a key from the [Diffie-Hellman] key between the two keys.

The two public keys are also used to construct the bet output which holds the coins until the outcome has been decided by the oracle.
The script locking the coins is a **1-of-2** with keys like:

```
1-of-2(P1 + O1, P2 + O2)
```

Where `P1` and `O1` represent the public key of the proposer and the outcome they are betting on respectively (`P2` and `O2` represent the same for the offerer).
If the oracle releases `O1` then the proposer will get the coins otherwise if the oracle releases `O2` the offerer gets them.
The Diffie-Hellman keys is also used to produce secret randomness (`R1` and `R2`) which both parties use to randomize the output script.
So the output script is really something like:

```
1-of-2(P1 + O1 + R1, P2 + O2 + R2)
```

This randomization means the output keys can't bet associated with the proposal and offer keys (`P1` and `P2`).
The order of the keys in the 1-of-2 is also randomized.

When the winner learns the secret for `O1` or `O2` from the oracle they can claim the coins because they can construct the secret key for `P1 + O1 + R1` or `P2 + O2 + R2`.
Note there is no real hurry for them to do so except that the coins can be [recovered from seed words](../backup-and-recovery.md) once they have been properly claimed.
