### `--fee <fee>`

Set the fee for the transaction.

You can choose from:

- `--fee=rate:4.5` set the fee to *4.5* sats-per-vbyte.
- `--fee=abs:500` set the fee to exactly 500 sats.
- `--fee=in-blocks:10` set the fee so it should get into the chain some time in the next 10 blocks.


The default is `in-blocks:1` i.e. set the fee so it gets into the next block.
