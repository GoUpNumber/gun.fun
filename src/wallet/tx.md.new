# gun tx

### `gun tx list`

Lists transactions associated with the wallet.
This only keeps track of transactions that come in and out of the main wallet.
For example, if you [`claim`](../bet/claim.md) coins from a won bet to an unrelated address it won't show up here.

### `gun tx show <txid>`

Shows more details about a particular transaction.
